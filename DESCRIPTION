Description: In divide and recombine framework, big data are divided into subsets, each analytic method is applied to subsets, and the outputs are recombined. The likelihood-model for logistic regression is a parametric probability density function of the parameters in the logistic regression. The density parameters are estimated by fitting the density to MCMC draws from each subset data-model likelihood function, and then the fitted densities are recombined.
